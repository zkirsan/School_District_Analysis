# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

The project consists of city school district data for analyzing information from various sources. In this project, the goal is to provide insights about performance trends and patterns from the preparing data. Those are going to use for informing discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. Furthermore, the other purpose of the project is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. Afterwards,  the made analyses will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. 

## Results

The school board has found signs of academic dishonesty in the students_ complete.csv file; specifically, reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth-graders seem to have been changed. For this reason, all analyses consist of comparative analyses according to the given data. The outcomes of the projects are;
